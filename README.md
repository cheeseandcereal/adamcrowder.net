# Adam Crowder Blog

This is the git repository for the content of [My Personal Blog](https://adamcrowder.net/)

## Info

This is a site with content source written in Markdown and built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Although the content is static, [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/) is used to provide dynamic comments for blog posts.

The hugo theme used is a minimal theme called [coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) which has been slightly modified.

## Hosting

The static portion of the site is self-hosted with nginx, with comments via a self-hosted Isso server, and all fronted by Cloudflare.

The configuration files for the nginx and Isso servers are provided.
